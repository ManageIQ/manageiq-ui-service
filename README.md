The Self Service UI for the [ManageIQ](http://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq) project

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Install nodejs 0.10.46 and npm 3.10.7
- Install bower and gulp globally: `npm install -g bower gulp`
- Have the [ManageIQ](http://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq) repo cloned into a
  directory named `manageiq`, and ready to be started.

### Repository and dependencies

- Clone this repo as a sibling to the `manageiq` directory:
  `git clone git@github.com:ManageIQ/manageiq-ui-self_service.git`
- `cd manageiq-ui-self_service`
- `bundle install`
- `npm install`

## Development

- In the `manageiq` directory, start the ManageIQ application with either
  `bundle exec rake evm:start` or `bundle exec rails server`.  This will start
  the server listening on http://localhost:3000, in order to serve up the REST
  API.
- In the `manageiq-ui-self_service` directory, start the development version of
  the self service UI with `gulp serve-dev`, which will start the UI listening
  on http://localhost:3001, and talking to the REST API at
  http://[::1]:3000.  This command will also open a browser page to
  http://localhost:3001/self_service/login.  
  The REST API host can be overriden via a PROXY\_HOST environment variable, for
  example: `PROXY_HOST=127.0.0.1:3000 gulp serve-dev`.

## Deployment

- In the `manageiq-ui-self_service` directory, build the production version of
  the self service UI with `gulp build`.  This will compile the assets and drop
  them into the `manageiq/public/self_service` directory.  The ManageIQ
  application can then be run with either `bundle exec rake evm:start` or
  `bundle exec rails server`, and the self service UI can be accessed at
  http://localhost:3000/self_service.
